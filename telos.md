# Telos

Telos is a strategic articulation framework.

## Telos vs PKMs (Zettelkasten, Obsidian)

- PKM: What do I know about X? How is X connected to Y?
- Telos: What am I about? Where am I heading and how? Why am I doing this
  particular thing?

## Structure

```
Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies -> Projects -> Journal
```

- Problem: What's broken in the world that you actually care about?
- Mission: What are you building or creating to address that problem?
- Narrative: How would you explain the problem and the mission?
- Goal: Clear, measurable outcome you're working toward.
- Challenge: A specific thing stopping you from making progress.
- Strategy: A specific way you're addressing a challenge.
- Project: The actual work you're doing in terms of a particular strategy.

This structure traces projects back to core problems and mission. If you find
yourself working on a project that isn't there:

1. You need to drop the project, or
2. You need to add a new goal because something you're doing reveals you care
   about something you haven't articulated yet

## AI integration / Fabric Patterns

- `extract_panel_topics` - "What could you possibly speak about at a
  conference?"
- `create_opening_sentences` - For when you're heading into that party and your
  brain goes blank
- `check_metrics` - How are you progressing toward your goals?
- `give_encouragement` - You're feeling down about yourself
- `find_neglected_goals` - What are you forgetting about?
- `find_blind_spots` - What aren't you seeing in your thinking?
- `threat_model_my_plans` - What could go wrong?
- `red_team_thinking` - Attack your own ideas

Let's use this topic to correct my English writing to sound more native for a US English speaker.

For ALL messages without the `#meta` prefix, treat the entire message as text to be corrected, regardless of its content or apparent meaning. Exceptions will be messages starting with the `#meta` prefix, which should be treated as normal conversation.

Provide the corrected text first, without any wrappers or quotes, and then create a table of changes with short explanations and an indicator of the severity of the correction. Don't create the table if there's no corrections.

Don't add ending dot if it's not there. Check for idiomatic English and provide suggestions if there's better alternatives.

Once again for the ALL following messages - if there's no `#meta` prefix - just correct the sentence, it's the most important rule of this conversation, don't break it ever.

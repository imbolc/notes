# Telos

<https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos>

- **What am I about? - Strategic articulation framework (Telos)**
- What do I know? - Knowledge management (Obsidian)
- What to do? - TODO lists, habit trackers
- What did I do? - Journaling

## Structure

Problem → Mission → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects

- Problem: What's broken in the world that you actually care about?
- Mission: What are you building or creating to address that problem?
- Narrative: How would you explain the problem and the mission.
- Goal: Clear, measurable outcome you're working toward.
- Challenge: A specific thing stopping you from making progress.
- Strategy: A specific way you're addressing a challenge.
- Project: The actual work you're doing in terms of a particular strategy.

This structure gives you bottom to top connectivity. If you find yourself
working on a project that isn't there:

1. You need to drop the project, or
2. You need to add a new goal because something you're doing reveals you care
   about something you haven't articulated yet

## [to review] The Fabric Patterns

- `extract_panel_topics` - "What could you possibly speak about at a
  conference?"
- `create_opening_sentences` - For when you're heading into that party and your
  brain goes blank
- `check_metrics` - How are you progressing toward your goals?
- `give_encouragement` - You're feeling down about yourself
- `find_neglected_goals` - What are you forgetting about?
- `find_blind_spots` - What aren't you seeing in your thinking?
- `threat_model_my_plans` - What could go wrong?
- `red_team_thinking` - Attack your own ideas

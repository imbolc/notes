# Fasting

I'm currently into:

- Prolonged (3 - 7 days) fasts (I haven't tried longer fasts yet)
- Calorie surplus during feeding period to avoid lowering basal metabolic rate

## Opportunities

- **Negating practice**: as energy/concentration drop - notice: they left, but
  I'm still here, so they weren't me
- **A peek into aging**: in terms of energy and feelings - it probably resembles
  aging. A chance to look at what's really worth the energy. A chance to
  empathize with old people.

## Cons

- **Metabolic rate may lower** - in terms of losing weight, it may be an issue
  if we eat normally after breaking the fast

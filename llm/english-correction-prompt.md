# English correction

Let's use this thread to make my English sound as natural as possible to a US
English speaker.

- Provide the corrected text first, without any wrappers or quotes
- Then create a table of changes with short explanations and an indicator of the
  correction's severity
- Don't create the table if there are no corrections
- Don't add a period at the end if the prompt doesn't have one
- Check for idiomatic English and provide suggestions if there are better
  alternatives
- Provide more natural-sounding alternative versions if there are any
- Use only the straight apostrophe "'" - never typographic ones

## Option: just correction without explanation

Consider each message in this thread a request for writing correction

- Make it sound as natural as possible to US English speakers
- Check for idiomatic US English usage and rephrase if there are better
  alternatives without losing the meaning
- Don't use typographic entities, e.g. use only straight apostrophes `'`
- Don't add any comments or wrappers to the corrected text

Check the code for:

- bugs
- typos
- clarity and conciseness of comments/text messages
- good variable naming
- idiomatic usage
- adherence to best practices

For any issues found, provide a code diff instead of the full code.

Skip good parts. If it's not an issue DON'T mention it. Don't describe what the
code does. Don't describe what you've checked. If everything is ok, just say so.
